**What's your idea?**
I believe the donut should spin *even harder*. Have you considered **4D spinning**?

**Why does this make the project better?**
Explain how it makes our ASCII world a better place.

**Possible Implementation
Maybe quantum entanglement? AI-powered spin optimization?

**Additional context**
Drop some memes, ASCII art, or motivation for the suggestion.
